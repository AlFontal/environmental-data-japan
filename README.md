# Japan's environmental Data

Repository collecting and organizing environmental data sources for Japan. 

Here, we have downloaded and processed the data available through the site made available by the Japanese National Institute for Environmental Studies (https://tenbou.nies.go.jp/download/). 

More specifically, we have downloaded the Air Pollution Monitoring data for a total of 2039 stations located around the whole country (represented as red dots in the map below):
